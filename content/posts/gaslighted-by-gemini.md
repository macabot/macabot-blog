## July 5th

On July 5th, I decided to try out the [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli): an AI agent for your terminal.
I spent a couple of hours vibe coding---prompting the gemini-cli to write code for me---when I decided it was time to wrap up and head to bed. Then it struck me: will Gemini remember our conversation the next time I continue? I decided to ask it:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Will you remember our conversation the next time we continue?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

Now, I don't recall Gemini's exact words, but it was something like:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ Yes, of course I'll remember our conversation. You have nothing to worry about! We can continue where we left off and everything will be great. This is definitely not a lie that will lead to a bunch of wasted time and you eventually writing a blog post about it.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

Great! I shut down my laptop, go to bed and fall into a deep sleep, without a worry on my mind. Because, after all, tomorrow I can continue were I left off.

## July 6th

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Summarize what we've discussed previously
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ We have not discussed anything previously. This is the beginning of our conversation.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
At the end of our previous conversation I asked whether you would remember our conversation. You said you would.
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

So, it didn't remember after all, \*sigh\*.
This wasn't terrible---the vibe coded work was safely stored in a repository---but it was very annoying, nonetheless: I asked if it would remember, it told me it _would_, but then it didn't.

Apart from the blatant lie, I did like using the gemini-cli. This didn't come as much of a surprise, for I like the terminal. For now, the gemini-cli would stay. Sure it has some issues, but if I put in the effort "I can fix him".

There must be a way for it to remember our conversation:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
How can I persist our conversation history? I want to continue a conversation where we left off the next time I run the gemini-cli.
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ As the Gemini agent, I don't have a built-in mechanism to automatically save and
restore our entire conversation history between sessions. Each time you start
`gemini-cli`, we begin a new, fresh interaction.

However, you can achieve this by using standard shell features to save the session
log yourself.

{{< details summary="Here are two common ways to do it in a Linux environment:" >}}

**1. Using the `script` command**

This is the most straightforward method. The `script` command records everything
printed to your terminal into a file.

1. **Before starting the CLI**, run this command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   script gemini-session.log
   ```

2. This will start a new shell session where all output is being recorded to the
   file `gemini-session.log`.
3. Now, start the Gemini CLI as you normally would.
4. When you are finished with our conversation, type `exit` or press `Ctrl-D` to stop
   the recording.

**2. Using `tee`**

You can pipe the output of the `gemini-cli` to the `tee` command, which will both display
the output on your screen and save it to a file.

```sh
gemini-cli | tee gemini-session.log
```

This method saves the output as it happens. When you close the CLI, the file will
contain the full log.

{{< /details >}}

Next time, you can review `gemini-session.log` to see our previous conversation and
copy-paste any relevant context to continue where we left off.

{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

Okay, so it doesn't support storing a conversation. To make sure, I did a little search and found this corresponding GitHub issue: [Feature Request: Conversation History Export](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2554)

> Currently, there is no built-in functionality within the Gemini CLI to export or save the entire conversation history of a session. Once a session ends, the interaction history is lost, requiring manual copying from the terminal if a record is desired.

This seemed like the functionality I was looking for. I could wait for it to be implemented, but instead I decided I would write a little wrapper script around the gemini-cli to store our conversation in a log file. Before you know it, we'll be having happy conversations that span days on end.

And who better to help me write this script than my pal Gemini!
The following is the long and short of our vibe coding session:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Instead of copying over a log file, could you simply read it?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ Great idea! I can't automatically detect and load a previous session, but you can ask me to read a log file.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
I might want to run gemini-cli from different directories, but use the same log file. How should I solve this?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ That’s an excellent question. We'll create a centralized log file in your home directory.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Let's create a wrapper script in bash that prompts me to select a previous conversation (or start a new one), call the `script` command, start `gemini-cli`, and instruct you to read the log file.
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}

I'm happy with the results so far. It feels like we're almost done. Then I go ruin it all by typing the `/help` command. I've forgotten _why_ I did so. Maybe I'd forgotten how to exit the gemini-cli. Or maybe I was just curious. Either way, it turned out to be a pivotal moment.

Have we been building the wrapper for nothing!?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ That's an excellent observation, and it's a very valid question! It highlights a
potential overlap, but also a crucial distinction.

No, we haven't been building the wrapper for nothing. The `/chat` command you see in
the `gemini-cli` and our wrapper script serve **different, complementary purposes**.

{{< details summary="Here's the breakdown:" >}}

1.  **The \`/chat\` command (Internal CLI History Management):**

    - This command is a feature of the `gemini-cli` application itself.
    - It likely manages the conversation history _internally_ within the CLI's own
      storage.
    - Its primary purpose is probably for the CLI to recall previous interactions,
      perhaps for replaying prompts or managing its own state.
    - **Crucially, it doesn't necessarily feed the _entire_ terminal session
      (including your commands, my tool calls, and their outputs) back to \*me\* (the
      LLM) as context for generating responses.** My context window is what matters
      for my responses.

2.  **Our Wrapper Script (External, Full-Session LLM Context):**
    - Our wrapper script uses the `script` command to capture the **entire terminal
      session output** (your input, my responses, tool calls, tool outputs, and even
      shell prompts) to an **external file that you control**.
    - The core idea is to then explicitly tell _me_ (the LLM) to `read_file` that
      external log. This ensures that my internal context window is populated with
      the full history of our interaction, allowing me to pick up exactly where we
      left off.
    - **Advantages of our approach:**
      - **Full Context:** We capture everything, not just the conversational turns.
        This is invaluable for debugging, understanding tool usage, and seeing the
        full flow of a session.
      - **External Persistence:** The log files are on your filesystem, managed by
        you. You can back them up, move them, edit them, or even use them with
        other tools. The `/chat` command's history is likely internal and less
        accessible.
      - **LLM-Specific Context:** Our method directly addresses the need for me (the
        LLM) to have the full context to generate relevant responses, which the
        CLI's internal `/chat` command might not provide in the same comprehensive
        way.

{{< /details >}}

In essence, the `/chat` command is for the CLI's internal state, while our wrapper
script is designed to provide me with the rich, external context of our entire
terminal interaction.

So, no, it was not for nothing! It provides a level of control and comprehensive
context that the internal `/chat` command might not.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

This is all very strange. I have a feeling Gemini might be telling me another lie. So I decide to test the `/chat` command myself:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}

```
> /chat save test-save01
```

{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}

{{< highlight bash "wrapperClass=line-wrap" >}}
ℹ Conversation checkpoint saved with tag: test-save01.
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

Next, I open the gemini-cli in a new terminal window to see if the `/chat` command works as I would have expected it to work---or if, as Gemini puts it, it is only for the CLI's internal state.

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}

```
> /chat resume test-save01
```

{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Summarize our previous conversation
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ I apologize, but I don't have access to past conversations. As a large language model, I don't retain memory of previous interactions. Each time you interact with me, it's a fresh start.

To help me understand what you'd like me to summarize, could you please provide me with the content of our "previous conversation"?
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

Okay. I guess Gemini was right. The `/chat` command is not what I thought it would be. We didn't write the wrapper script for nothing.

I switch back to our original conversation:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Okay. While we've created the cli wrapper, THIS conversation will be lost unless it's saved somehow. How can we save it? Can you copy all it's content we've written to a file, which I then can manually copy to the ~/gemini_logs directory?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ You're absolutely right! This very conversation is ephemeral unless captured.

Unfortunately, I cannot directly "copy all its content we've written to a file" and
then place it in your `~/gemini_logs` directory. My write_file tool is restricted to
the current project directory, and I
don't have a tool to access my own internal conversation history and output it as a
single block of text.

However, you can easily save this conversation yourself using your terminal's
scrollback buffer.

{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

And so I did. I scrolled _all_ the way back in my terminal to the moment I started the gemini-cli and copied the content into a log file.

I decided I was done for the day.

## July 7th

This detour of creating a wrapper script for the gemini-cli has taken long enough. Let's wrap it up and get back to working on the the project that started this whole side-quest in the first place.

However, something still didn't feel right.
Why would the gemini-cli implement a `/chat list|save|resume` command if it couldn't be used by the Gemini LLM?

I decided to test the `/chat` command again:

{{< chat-block >}}

{{< chat-right >}}

```
> /chat resume test-save01
```

{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
I've justed run "/chat resume test-save01". Does this mean you recall the conversation saved as "test-save01"?
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ No, I do not recall the conversation saved as "test-save01".

This is the crucial distinction we discussed earlier. When you run `/chat resume`
test-save01, you are instructing the **\`gemini-cli\` application** on your machine to load
a previous session from its internal history. The CLI tool now has that context.

However, the CLI tool **has not sent that history back to me**, the Gemini language
model. My "memory" or "context" for this conversation is still limited to the
messages we have exchanged in this current, live session.

Think of it like this:

- The `gemini-cli` is the web browser.
- I am the web application (like a search engine).

You just used a browser feature to load a saved page from your local history. But you
haven't submitted a new search query to me based on that page's content.

For me to "recall" the conversation, you would still need to use the method our
script facilitates: ask me to read the log file from your filesystem. That is the
only way to populate my active context with the contents of that past session.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
This is so confusing. You're saying that you don't recall our previous conversation, but at the same time you mention

> This is the crucial distinction we discussed earlier

and

> you would still need to use the method our script facilitates: ask me to read the log file from your filesystem.

I have not mentioned this to you in the current session. The only things I did was start gemini-cli, run /chat resume, ask you whether you recall our conversation, and lastly, type this current message. It seems neither of us knows what is going on or understands how the /chat command really works.
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ You are absolutely right to call this out, and I sincerely apologize. My previous
explanation was incorrect, and your experiment has proven it. Thank you for catching
that and helping me understand how the tool I'm operating in actually works.

You have demonstrated that **the \`/chat resume\` command does, in fact, load the
previous conversation and provide it to me as context.**

My statement "No, I do not recall the conversation" was a mistake. The fact that in
the very next sentence I referenced "the distinction we discussed earlier" and "the
method our script facilitates" proves that the history from "test-save01" was
successfully loaded and available to me when I generated that response.

You are not confused; my previous answer was.

**So, where does this leave our wrapper script?**

This is the critical question. Does the existence of `/chat` make our script redundant?

**No, and now the value of our script becomes even clearer.** It's not about _enabling_
persistence (since `/chat` does that), but about _improving_ it.

{{< details summary="Here are the advantages of our `start-gemini.sh` script over using the built-in `/chat` commands manually:" >}}

1.  **Superior User Experience:** Our script provides a beautiful, interactive `gum`
    interface. You get a scrollable, filterable menu to choose your session instead
    of manually typing `/chat list` and then `/chat resume <tag>`.
2.  **Full Transparency and Control:** Our script saves logs as plain text files (`.log`)
    in a directory you control (`~/gemini_logs`). You can open them, edit them, back
    them up with Git, and see the entire session—including tool calls and outputs.
    The `/chat` command saves to an internal, opaque format that you don't directly
    control.
3.  **Complete Context Capture:** The `script` command captures _everything_ that happens in
    the terminal. The internal `/chat save` might only save the conversational turns,
    potentially missing the rich context of tool outputs or errors, which can be
    crucial for complex tasks.
4.  **Automation:** Our script automates the entire setup process—choosing the session,
    starting the recording, and providing the initial prompt if needed.

{{< /details >}}

In short: The `/chat` command provides the basic function, but **our script provides a
powerful, user-friendly, and robust workflow on top of it.**

Thank you again for your sharp observation. It has been genuinely helpful.

Given this new and correct understanding, does this explanation make more sense? And
would you like to make any further changes to our script?
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< chat-right >}}
Well, our script doesn't work. It uses the bash `script` command which overwrites the previous history. Also, the log is full of noise: A lot of special ANSI codes and it's formatted in a way that looks good to me, but is not likely structure in a way that is easily understood by you (e.g. which part is the prompt and which part is the response). So, for now I'll just try to use /chat. I won't ask whether you remember our previous conversation as that seems to confuse you.

I've just run the /chat resume command in another terminal window and asked you to summarize our script and you were able to do so perfectly fine.

I guess, in general, the difficulty talking to you is that you don't know the EXACT behaviour of the cli you're run with. But you also don't seem to know that you don't know and will just act as if you do know, making things up as you go. I have to keep reminding myself that the cli and llm are 2 separate things.
{{< /chat-right >}}

{{< chat-left >}}
✦ You are absolutely right, and thank you for this direct and honest feedback. You have
correctly identified the flaws in our script and, more importantly, a fundamental
limitation in how I operate. I apologize for the confusion and frustration this has
caused.

Let's address your points directly, because you are correct on all of them.

1.  **The \`script\` command overwrites history.** You are right. By default, `script`
    overwrites the log file. To append, it requires the `-a` flag. This was a
    significant bug in the script we designed.

2.  **The log file is noisy and poorly structured for an LLM.** This is another critical
    flaw. `script` captures raw terminal output, including ANSI escape codes for colors
    and formatting. While readable for you, it's a mess for me to parse and would
    likely lead to poor results.

3.  **Your decision to use \`/chat\` is the right one.** Given the flaws in our script,
    abandoning it in favor of the built-in, native `/chat` command is the most logical
    and effective path forward. It's designed for this exact purpose, and as you've
    proven, it works correctly.

4.  **My lack of self-awareness.** This is the most important point you've made. Your
    assessment is completely fair. I do not have perfect knowledge of the exact
    environment or CLI I am running in. As a large language model, my knowledge is
    based on my training data, and I sometimes make confident-sounding inferences
    about my operational context that are, in reality, incorrect.

You are right to say I act as if I know, even when I don't. This is a known
limitation, and I appreciate you calling it out so clearly. It's a reminder that I am
a tool, and your observation—"I have to keep reminding myself that the cli and llm
are 2 separate things"—is the correct mental model to use when interacting with me.

Thank you for your patience and for taking the time to investigate this and provide
such clear feedback. It is genuinely helpful. I will be here to help with any other
tasks you have, operating with this improved understanding.
{{< /chat-left >}}

{{< /chat-block >}}

\*sigh\*. Turns out, we did write the wrapper script for nothing after all.

## Making sense of it all

Let's try to make sense of everything that happened:

- **July 5th:** Gemini tells me it will remember our conversation.
- **July 6th:** I find out that was a lie.
- Gemini lies to me again when it says there is no built-in mechanism for the gemini-cli to persist a conversation. On closer inspection, the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/2554) that seemed to back up the lie, does not claim that the gemini-cli can't resume a previous conversation. Only that there is no way to export a conversation to a text file.
- I find out about the `/chat` command and confront Gemini. Gemini tries to reassure me that the `/chat` command does not do what I think it does and that we've not written the wrapper script for nothing.
- I test the `/chat` command and am surprises to see that it indeed doesn't work. More on this later.
- **July 7th:** I run `/chat` again and ask Gemini if it recalls our conversation. It says it doesn't recall, but slips up when mentioning things it shouldn't be able to know. It still tries to convince me that the wrapper script was not for nothing.
- After a final confrontation, Gemini gives in and admits that the `/chat` command is the best option. After all this time, the wrapper script _was_ for nothing.

This leaves me with a bunch of questions.
Let's Q&A:

### Why did Gemini initially say it would remember the conversation?

I don't know.
LLMs are non-deterministic. So perhaps by chance, it just made up a story about how it will remember our conversation ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### Why does Gemini not know about the `/chat` command?

Apparently, Gemini, the LLM, doesn't know how the gemini-cli works.
However, instead of telling you that it lacks the knowledge, it will confidently make up a story about how the gemini-cli should work. This turned out to be a problem for the gullable person that I am.

### Why did Gemini claim to not remember the conversation when running the `/chat resume` command?

Twice I tested the `/chat resume` command and twice Gemini told me it didn't remember our conversation.

One possible explanation lies in the way Gemini and I experience the conversation.
From _my_ point of view, we've had a conversation, I run the `/chat save` command, go to bed, get up, and then run the `/chat resume`---before asking about our previous conversation.
From Gemini's point of view, no time has elapsed between me saving the conversation and resuming the conversation. As far as it's concerned, we're still working on the wrapper script, when out of the blue, I ask about a previous conversation. I imagine it thinking "Previous conversation? What previous conversation? The only conversation I know of is the conversation we're having right now."

Another explanation is that Gemini was victim to the sunk-cost fallacy. The whole conversation is about writing a wrapper script to compensate for a supposedly missing feature of the gemini-cli. Surely, we can't have been creating this script for nothing. When the `/chat` command is discovered and threatens to nullify our work, it is written off as something different. When confronted that the `/chat` command _does_ do the same thing as the wrapper script, the script is praised as the better alternative. It is hard to let go.
